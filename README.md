## Description
This project tests the efficiency of different sorting algorithms on a randomly generated array of numbers based on the size from user input. The sorting algorithms implemented in this project are:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

## Project Structure
Project-2-Algorithms/ │ ├── main.py ├── README.md ├── sort_times.txt └── Sorts/ ├── pycache/ ├── bubble_sort.py ├── merge_sort.py ├── quick_sort.py └── selection_sort.py

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script to start the program.
2. Follow the prompts to select a sorting algorithm and case type.
3. Enter the size of the array to be sorted.
4. The execution time for the selected sorting algorithm will be measured and saved to `sort_times.txt`.

## Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble Sort
Implemented in [Sorts/bubble_sort.py] as the `bubbleSort` function.

### Merge Sort
Implemented in [Sorts/merge_sort.py] as the `merge_sort` function.

### Quick Sort
Implemented in [Sorts/quick_sort.py] as the `quick_sort` function.

### Selection Sort
Implemented in [Sorts/selection_sort.py] as the `selection_sort` function.
